		<h2>Aspirations</h2>
			<p>Upon graduating I want to first and foremost be <em>employed</em>. 
				I am considering working for a consulting firm or a bank 
				upon completion of my Bachelor of Arts in Economics. 
				After working for a couple of years I would like to go 
				back to school for an MBA. I hope an MBA will allow me 
				to work better jobs in the field of my choosing. Iâ€™d 
				like to travel, own a dog, someday have a family, and 
				above all keep giving my parents reasons to be <strong>proud 
				of me</strong>.</p>
